# Convert h5 model to tflite with inference

## This is what I described in the notebook:

  1. How to convert tf h5 model to tflite model to reduce its size (from 4x to 10x), 

  2. How to build image classification inference with tf
  
  3. How to build image classification inference with tflite


**Note: tflite model run more slower than the normal model, this is because it's built to run with best peroformnce on arm processors.**
